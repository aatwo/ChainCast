# ChainCast

<b>What is ChainCast?</b> Don't get too excited, this was a small project undetaken as part of a game jam / learning exercise set with the theme 'chain cast'. My very rough implementation is a local multiplayer game setting players in a destructable maze with other players and a single persuing monster. The monster always follows the closest players and it is possible to 'cast chains' at people and / or the monster to trap them momentarily. Once caught by the monster you are out of the game.
  
<b>What tech stack was used?</b> C++ and SDL2

<b>Why would you use such a low level tech stack for a game jam?</b> This was less about the game and more about the desire for me to work more with raw C++, SDL2, Makefiles and Visual Studio Codes C++ plugin. You could probably crank out something better than this using Unity in an hour but this was more about learning than anything else.
